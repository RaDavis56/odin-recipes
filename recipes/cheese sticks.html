        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>MOzzarella Cheese Sticks. Either string cheese or block cut</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Onion Powder</li>
            <li>Dried Oregano</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Vegatable oil</li>
            <li>Marinara Sauce (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Prepare the Cheese:</h4>Cut mozzarella into sticks about 3 to 4 inches long if not using pre-cut string cheese. Place in the freezer for 30–60 minutes to help prevent melting during frying.</li>

            <li><h4>Set up the breading Station</h4>In one bowl, place about 1/2 cup of flour.
                <p>In a second bowl, whisk 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of milk.</p>
                <p>In a third bowl, mix equal parts Italian-style breadcrumbs and panko (about 1 cup total), then season with 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, salt, and pepper to taste.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Bread the Cheese Sticks</h4>Dip each frozen cheese stick first in flour, then in the egg mixture, and finally coat thoroughly in the breadcrumb mix.
                <p>For extra crispiness, repeat the egg and breadcrumb steps for a double coating</p></li>
            <li><h4>Freeze Again, (optional)</h4>Place breaded sticks back in the freezer for 20–30 minutes. This helps them keep their shape and prevents leaking while frying</li>
            <li><h4>Frying Process</h4>First heat the oil. Pour vegetable oil into a deep pan or pot to about 2 inches deep. Heat to 350°F (175°C).
                <p>Fry in small batches for about 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Do not overcrowd the pan</p>
                <p>Then you want to start draining and cooling. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Serve Hot</h4>Enjoy immediately with warm marinara sauce or your favorite dip</li>
        </ol>
