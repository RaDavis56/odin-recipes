        <ol>
            <li><h4>Cook the Bacon</h4>In a skillet over medium heat, cook bacon strips until crispy, about 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease.</li>
            <li><h4>Prep the Bread</h4>Spread softened butter (or mayo, if preferred) on one side of each slice of bread</li>
            <li><h4>Assemble the Sandwich</h4>Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, on a skillet or pan. <p>Layer with 1–2 slices of cheese, 2–3 strips of cooked bacon, and an additional slice of cheese for extra meltiness.</p><p>Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Grill the Sandwich</h4>Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the sandwich for about <strong>3–4 minutes per side</strong>, pressing gently with a spatula, until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is fully melted.</li>
            <li><h4>Serve Hot</h4>Slice and enjoy immediately optionally with tomato soup, a pickle, or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
